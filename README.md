## Contributing

You can contribute in different ways:

* pick up an issue and do the coding, preferably bugs over features
* increase the test coverage
* improve the documentation
* report bugs
* suggest new features and improvements
* spread the word

Before [creating an issue](https://github.com/estivensh4/aws-kmp/issues/new), please make sure that there is no [existing issue](https://github.com/estivensh4/aws-kmp/issues) with the same topic.

Branching Model
---------------
The development is done with feature branches such as `feature/xxx`. Any bug fixes for a particular release should target a release branch such as `release/1.2.x`.

Project members push directly to branches in the main repository. External contributors work on the according branch in their own clone and issue a pull request.

You can, of course, suggest any change by a pull request, but we suggest that you create an issue first. Creating an issue helps to avoid waste of your time.
