     * Returns a pre-signed URL for accessing an Amazon S3 resource.
     *
     *
     *
     * Pre-signed URLs allow clients to form a URL for an Amazon S3 resource,
     * and then sign it with the current AWS security credentials. The
     * pre-signed URL can be shared to other users, allowing access to the
     * resource without providing an account's AWS security credentials.
     *
     *
     *
     * Pre-signed URLs are useful in many situations where AWS security
     * credentials aren't available from the client that needs to make the
     * actual request to Amazon S3.
     *
     *
     *
     * For example, an application may need remote users to upload files to the
     * application owner's Amazon S3 bucket, but doesn't need to ship the
     * AWS security credentials with the application. A pre-signed URL
     * to PUT an object into the owner's bucket can be generated from a remote
     * location with the owner's AWS security credentials, then the pre-signed
     * URL can be passed to the end user's application to use.
     *
     *
     *
     * If you are generating presigned url for [AWS KMS](http://aws.amazon.com/kms/)-encrypted objects, you need to
     * specify the correct region of the bucket on your client and configure AWS
     * Signature Version 4 for added security. For more information on how to do
     * this, see
     * http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAWSSDK.html#

     * @param bucketName The name of the bucket containing the desired object.
     * @param key The key in the specified bucket under which the desired object
     * is stored.
     * @param expiration The time at which the returned pre-signed URL will
     * expire.
     * @return A pre-signed URL which expires at the specified time, and can be
     * used to allow anyone to download the specified object from S3,
     * without exposing the owner's AWS secret access key.
     * @throws AmazonClientException If there were any problems pre-signing the
     * request for the specified S3 object.
